    "Python has automated memory management, which makes use of trash collection and reference counting. Memory is freed up when the number of references to an object is zero, which is tracked via reference counting. Garbage collection effectively maintains memory pools for object allocation and deals with circular references. Efficient memory consumption is facilitated by Python's memory optimisation mechanisms, such as object and string interning. Programmatic control is provided by the gc module, and memory profiling tools help engineers find leaks and trends in the system. All things considered, Python's memory management makes development easier and emphasises automated memory handling for higher productivity."
